# Discogs add all of format to wantlist

Due to [this thread](http://www.discogs.com/forum/thread/363499) being unfulfilled after 2+ years, I decided to use this as an oppourtunity to teach myself some jquery (I am a novice).

# Installation

Install [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) and point your browser [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yeahdef/discogs_format_to_wantlist/master/discogs_format_to_wantlist.user.js). Tampermonkey should provide you with an installation button. It should run on all 'master' release pages on discogs.

# TODO

- Make it a chrome extension

note: It ignores 'Unofficial' releases.
